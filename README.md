# spacedTime

Remember the important things in life. Permenantly store informaiton in your brain, not the cloud. Using spaced time repition techniques, we will create an app that allows you to easily recall and memorize.

## How to get started

```
1. yarn global add spacedTime
2. spacedTime add "What is my mother's name?" "Some Ting Wong"
3. spacedTime recall #todo
```

## spacedTime recall

This will ask you the question. Traditional time spaced reptition apps, do not ask for input. It only asks if you were able to remember.

```
> spacedTime recall #todo
What is my mother's name?

yes or no?
```

Given how frequently you answer yes, the question will be asked less over time. If you answer no, you'll be asked this question more frequently.
